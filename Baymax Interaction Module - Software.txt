### Step 2: Software Setup for Baymax

To bring Baymax to life, we need to set up software for voice recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech. Hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step guide.

---

### **1. Software Components**

#### **a. Operating System**
- If using a Raspberry Pi, ensure the Raspberry Pi OS is installed and updated.
- For laptops, ensure you have a Linux distribution or Windows/MacOS with a Python environment set up.

#### **b. Programming Language**
- Python will be the core programming language because of its rich libraries for AI and hardware interfacing.

#### **c. Libraries and Tools**
- **Speech Recognition**: To process voice input (e.g., Google Speech Recognition API).
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: For voice responses (e.g., gTTS, pyttsx3, or Amazon Polly).
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: To understand user commands (e.g., NLTK, spaCy, or OpenAI's GPT).
- **Device Control**: Libraries like `gpiozero` for Raspberry Pi hardware (if applicable).
- **API Integration**: Requests for fetching real-time data or controlling external systems.

### **3. Setting Up Speech Recognition**

#### **a. Install and Test the Microphone**
1. Use the `SpeechRecognition` library to capture and process speech:
   ```python
   import speech_recognition as sr

   recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
   with sr.Microphone() as source:
       print("Say something!")
       audio = recognizer.listen(source)

   try:
       print("You said: " + recognizer.recognize_google(audio))
   except sr.UnknownValueError:
       print("Sorry, I could not understand the audio.")
   except sr.RequestError:
       print("Error connecting to Google Speech Recognition service.")
   ```

2. Save this script as `test_microphone.py` and run it:
   ```bash
   python3 test_microphone.py
   ```

#### **b. Troubleshooting Speech Recognition**
- If the microphone isn't working, ensure that the correct device is set as the input in `SpeechRecognition`.

### **4. Setting Up Text-to-Speech**

#### **a. Using pyttsx3**
1. A simple TTS example:
   ```python
   import pyttsx3

   engine = pyttsx3.init()
   engine.say("Hello, I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.")
   engine.runAndWait()
   ```

2. Save this script as `test_tts.py` and run it:
   ```bash
   python3 test_tts.py
   ```

#### **b. Using gTTS**
1. Generate an audio file from text:
   ```python
   from gtts import gTTS
   import os

   tts = gTTS("Hello, I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.", lang='en')
   tts.save("baymax_intro.mp3")
   os.system("mpg321 baymax_intro.mp3")
   ```

---

### **5. Setting Up Natural Language Processing (Optional)**

#### **a. Install and Use NLTK**
1. Install NLTK and download required datasets:
   ```bash
   pip3 install nltk
   python3 -m nltk.downloader punkt
   ```

2. Example of basic NLP:
   ```python
   import nltk
   from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

   text = "How can I assist you today?"
   print(word_tokenize(text))
   ```

#### **b. Using GPT or LLMs**
1. Install the OpenAI library:
   ```bash
   pip3 install openai
   ```

2. Example for generating a response:
   ```python
   import openai

   openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

   response = openai.Completion.create(
       engine="text-davinci-003",
       prompt="What can you do as Baymax?",
       max_tokens=50
   )
   print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
   ```

---

### **6. Creating the Baymax Software Framework**

#### **a. Combine Speech Recognition and TTS**
1. Basic Baymax interaction:
   ```python
   import speech_recognition as sr
   import pyttsx3

   recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
   engine = pyttsx3.init()

   while True:
       with sr.Microphone() as source:
           print("Listening...")
           try:
               audio = recognizer.listen(source)
               command = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
               print(f"You said: {command}")

               if "Baymax" in command:
                   engine.say("Hello, I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.")
                   engine.runAndWait()

               if "exit" in command:
                   engine.say("Goodbye!")
                   engine.runAndWait()
                   break

           except Exception as e:
               print("Error:", e)
   ```

---

### **7. Testing the Software**

- Run the script and test the systemâ€™s ability to recognize commands and respond with speech.
- Troubleshoot by debugging errors in command recognition or audio output.
 ðŸ˜Š

To enhance the software phase, we can add additional capabilities to make Baymax more interactive, intelligent, and functional. Hereâ€™s how we can build upon the foundation:

---

### **1. Improved Speech Recognition and Error Handling**

#### **a. Add Continuous Listening**
Instead of waiting for specific inputs, Baymax can listen continuously for a trigger word (e.g., "Hey Baymax") to activate its functions.

```python
import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3

recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
engine = pyttsx3.init()

def speak(text):
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()

def listen():
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        try:
            print("Listening...")
            audio = recognizer.listen(source)
            command = recognizer.recognize_google(audio).lower()
            return command
        except sr.UnknownValueError:
            return "I couldn't understand you"
        except sr.RequestError:
            return "Error connecting to the speech service"

while True:
    command = listen()
    if "baymax" in command:
        speak("Hello, I am Baymax. How can I assist you?")
    elif "exit" in command or "goodbye" in command:
        speak("Goodbye!")
        break
    else:
        print(f"Command received: {command}")
```

#### **b. Add Custom Commands**
Define specific commands for Baymax to respond to:
- "How's the weather?" (connect to a weather API)
- "Tell me a joke" (fetch a random joke using an API)

---

### **2. Integration with External APIs**

#### **a. Weather Updates**
1. Use the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather updates:
   ```bash
   pip3 install requests
   ```

2. Example code:
   ```python
   import requests

   def get_weather(city="New York"):
       api_key = "your_openweather_api_key"
       url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={api_key}&units=metric"
       response = requests.get(url)
       data = response.json()
       if data.get("main"):
           temp = data["main"]["temp"]
           description = data["weather"][0]["description"]
           return f"The current temperature in {city} is {temp}Â°C with {description}."
       else:
           return "I couldn't fetch the weather for you."

   city = "San Francisco"
   print(get_weather(city))
   ```

3. Integrate into Baymax's conversation:
   ```python
   if "weather" in command:
       city = "New York"  # Default city or parse from command
       speak(get_weather(city))
   ```

#### **b. Jokes and Fun Facts**
1. Use a joke API like [icanhazdadjoke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/):
   ```python
   def get_joke():
       url = "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/"
       headers = {"Accept": "application/json"}
       response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
       data = response.json()
       return data.get("joke", "I couldn't find a joke for you.")
   ```

2. Integrate into Baymax:
   ```python
   if "joke" in command:
       speak(get_joke())
   ```

---

### **3. Emotion Detection Integration**

#### **a. Using Pre-Trained Models**
Leverage emotion detection APIs or libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, or pre-trained APIs like Microsoft Azure Emotion API).

1. Install the required library:
   ```bash
   pip3 install deepface
   ```

2. Basic emotion detection:
   ```python
   from deepface import DeepFace

   def detect_emotion(image_path):
       analysis = DeepFace.analyze(img_path=image_path, actions=["emotion"])
       return analysis["dominant_emotion"]

   print(detect_emotion("test_image.jpg"))
   ```

3. Camera Integration (Raspberry Pi or laptop):
   - Capture a photo and analyze the emotion in real-time.

---

### **4. Add Smart Reminders and Notes**

#### **a. Reminder Functionality**
1. Store reminders locally or in a cloud database.
2. Code example:
   ```python
   import time

   reminders = []

   def add_reminder(reminder, delay):
       reminders.append(reminder)
       time.sleep(delay)
       speak(f"Reminder: {reminder}")

   # Example: add_reminder("Take your medicine", 60)
   ```

3. Extend to allow multiple reminders and scheduling:
   - Use `schedule` or `APScheduler`.

---

### **5. Natural Language Processing Enhancements**

#### **a. Use GPT or ChatGPT**
Improve conversational abilities by integrating GPT models:
1. Install the OpenAI library:
   ```bash
   pip3 install openai
   ```

2. Example integration:
   ```python
   import openai

   openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

   def chat_with_gpt(prompt):
       response = openai.Completion.create(
           engine="text-davinci-003",
           prompt=prompt,
           max_tokens=150
       )
       return response.choices[0].text.strip()

   print(chat_with_gpt("What is your purpose, Baymax?"))
   ```

3. Use this for general queries, personal conversations, or extended functionality.

---

### **6. Personalization Features**

#### **a. User Profiles**
Store user preferences and details (e.g., name, favorite activities):
- Use a simple JSON file to save data:
   ```python
   import json

   user_data = {"name": "Ira", "preferences": {"language": "English", "hobbies": ["reading", "coding"]}}
   with open("user_data.json", "w") as file:
       json.dump(user_data, file)

   # Load and use data
   with open("user_data.json", "r") as file:
       user = json.load(file)
       print(f"Hello, {user['name']}!")
   ```

#### **b. Custom Greetings**
Welcome the user based on the time of day:
   ```python
   import datetime

   def get_greeting():
       hour = datetime.datetime.now().hour
       if hour < 12:
           return "Good morning!"
       elif 12 <= hour < 18:
           return "Good afternoon!"
       else:
           return "Good evening!"
   ```

---

### **7. Testing and Debugging**
- Test each feature independently before integrating them.
- Use logs to debug issues:
   ```python
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
   logging.info("Testing Baymax functionality...")
   ```
